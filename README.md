# 📈 Task 7: Sales Forecasting  

## 📌 Internship  
This project is part of my **Machine Learning Internship at Elevvo Pathways**.  

## 📊 Project Overview  
The aim of this project is to **forecast future sales** using historical sales data. Time-based features such as day, month, and lag values were engineered, followed by regression models to predict next-period sales.  

## 🗂 Dataset  
- Recommended: [Walmart Sales Forecast Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  
- Provides historical sales data across different departments and stores.  

## ⚙️ Steps Performed  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – handled missing values, created time-based features.  
2. **Feature Engineering** – added lag values, rolling averages, and seasonal decomposition.  
3. **Model Training** – applied regression models to forecast sales.  
4. **Visualization** – plotted actual vs. predicted sales over time.  

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  

## 📚 Covered Topics  
- Time Series Forecasting  
- Regression  

## 🌟 Bonus Experiments  
- Applied **rolling averages** and **seasonal decomposition**.  
- Tried **XGBoost** and **LightGBM** with time-aware validation.  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aafia1/sales-forecasting.git
   cd sales-forecasting
